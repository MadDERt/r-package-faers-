\textbf{Motivation:} The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS)
serves as a critical database for monitoring post-marketing drug
safety.However, the primary focus on safety signal detection within
FAERS has left a significant gap in integrating pharmacovigilance
analysis with genetic tools.Thus, we aim to effectively utilize FAERS
data to bridge pharmacovigilance with genetic analysis, thereby
enhancing the precision of safety assessments and facilitating the
development of personalized medicine approaches.\\
\textbf{Results:} We developed the R package faers, which seamlessly
connects the FAERS database to the R programming language and provides a
unified approach for the seamless execution of pharmacovigilance
analysis and the integration of genetic tools in R.\\

\section{Introduction}

The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) is the core database for
post-marketing safety monitoring of all approved drugs and therapeutic
biologics by the FDA. As required by regulations, it consolidates
mandatory adverse event reports submitted by pharmaceutical companies,
as well as voluntary first-hand information reported by individuals and
healthcare professionals. The data, which has been collected since
January 2004 and is continuously updated on a quarterly basis, includes
eight types of documents: demographic and administrative information,
detailed drug information, indications for use, report sources, drug
start and end dates, patient outcomes, reports of therapeutic failure,
and adverse events. Its core value is reflected in key areas such as
early safety signal detection, risk assessment, and drug labeling
revisions, providing direct evidence for the FDA to formulate drug
safety policies and risk management measures.

Currently, FAERS research has formed a tripartite landscape of
``official---open-source---R ecosystem'': The official path still
requires researchers to download quarterly files, deduplicate and clean
them, recode with MedDRA, and then manually invoke algorithms. Although
the FAERS Public Dashboard provides zero-code visualization and
download, it lacks a batch analysis interface. In the open-source
platform, OpenVigil 2.1, by pre-hosting cleaned data from 2004 to 2022,
supports one-click output of PRR/ROR after online setting of
drug-event-time window, but its cross-platform reproducibility is
limited. AERSMine, leveraging Spark to integrate 2.1 million reports,
offers interactive differential efficacy forest plots, yet still cannot
directly connect to the Bioconductor genetics pipeline. DiAna\_package
encapsulates downloading, cleaning, standardization, signaling, and
genetics integration into a single R command, being the first to
incorporate population genotypes into the signal model, but it leaves
gaps in environment locking and full-field integrity, which provides an
entry point for the proposed unified faers framework in this paper.

To systematically address the shortcomings of existing tools in terms of
reproducibility, integration into the R ecosystem, and in-depth mining
of genetic information, we developed the faers package. This package
connects the FAERS database to R through a unified pipeline, enabling
one-click data download, cleaning, standardization, and signal
detection. It also seamlessly integrates with the Bioconductor genetics
analysis framework, supporting high-throughput association analysis of
population-differentiated polymorphisms and drug pathways, thereby
providing reproducible and scalable decision support for precision
medicine.

\section{Methods}

The workflow for pharmacovigilance analysis using the faers package
mainly consists of the following four steps: (i) inspecting FAERS
metadata; (ii) downloading and parsing the quarterly FAERS data files;
(iii) standardization and deduplication; (iv) conducting
pharmacovigilance analysis.
